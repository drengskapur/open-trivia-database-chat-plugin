Open Trivia Chat Plugin is a Cloudflare Worker that provides a proxy for the Open Trivia Database API. It serves trivia questions and answers and exposes an OpenAPI schema and a manifest file for integration with chat platforms and other services.

## üîß Installation

1. Access the ChatGPT UI and select the plugin model from the top drop-down menu.
1. Click on `Plugins` > `Plugin store` > `Install an unverified plugin`.
1. Provide the service URL:

   ```console

   ```

1. This plugin is still in the process of being verified: click `Continue`.

Once the plugin is installed and activated, you can use it in chat conversations. When a relevant question is asked, the model will invoke an API call to the Open Trivia Database API. The model will incorporate API results in its response to the user.
